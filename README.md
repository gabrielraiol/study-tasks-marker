## Description

This is a study task marker with a timer, where you can add tasks to a list and start the counter with a maximum time of 01h30m. At the end of the countdown, your task is marked as completed.

## Skills

Here I put into practice the concept of rendering components, TypeScript with props, using NPM for local server and project creation, applying SCSS modules to styling, states of an element, and React's DRY principles, as well as using of custom hooks. I hope you like the result!
